                    My journey began on the streets, where I fell in love with the raw energy and creativity that breaking offers. Since then, I've dedicated my life to mastering the craft and sharing it with others.
                    Throughout my career, I've had the privilege of performing on various stages, competing in numerous battles, and collaborating with some of the best dancers in the world. These experiences have shaped my style and deep understanding of breakdance culture.
                    <br><br> Here on my website, you'll find a collection of breaking classes, tutorials, and resources designed to help dancers improve their skills. Whether you're a beginner looking to learn the basics or an experienced b-boy or b-girl aiming to refine your technique, my goal is to provide you with the guidance and inspiration you need to succeed.
                    What sets my approach apart is a focus on both the technical and artistic aspects of breaking. I believe in teaching not just the moves, but also the technique, musicality, and spirit that make breaking so special. My tutorials break down complex moves into manageable steps, ensuring that you can progress at your own pace and build a solid foundation.
                    <br><br> Join me on this exciting journey, and let's push the boundaries of what we can achieve on the dance floor. Together, we'll explore the vibrant world of breaking and create new experiences.
                    <br><br> Thank you for visiting, and I can't wait to train with you!
                    <br><br> Keep breaking, Mauricio
